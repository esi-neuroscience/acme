# Changelog of ACME
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## [2022.12] - 2022-12-15
Bugfix release.

### CHANGED
- If not provided, a new lower default value of one is used for `n_workers_startup`

### FIXED
- Updated memory estimation logic on the ESI HPC cluster: if ACME does not
  handle result output distribution but memory estimation is still requested
  do not perform `memEstRun` keyword injection.

## [2022.11] - 2022-11-11
Major changes in managing auto-generated files
- If `write_worker_results` is `True`, ACME now creates an aggregate results
  container comprised of external links that point to actual data in HDF5
  payload files generated by parallel workers.
- Optionally, results can be slotted into a single dataset/array (via the
  `result_shape` keyword).
- If `single_file` is `True`, ACME stores results of parallel compute runs
  not in dedicated payload files but all workers write to a single aggregate
  results container.
- By providing `output_dir`, the location of auto-generated HDF5/pickle files can
  be customized
- Entities in a distributed computing client that concurrently process tasks
  are now consistently called "workers" (in line with dask terminology).
  Accordingly the keywords `n_jobs`, `mem_per_job`, `n_jobs_startup` and
  `workers_per_job` have been renamed `n_workers`, `mem_per_worker`,
  `n_workers_startup` and `processes_per_worker`, respectively. To ensure
  compatibility  with existing code, the former names have been marked
  deprecated but were not removed and are still functional.

A full list of changes is provided below

### NEW
- Included keyword `output_dir` in `ParallelMap` that allows to customize the
  storage location of files auto-generated by ACME (HDF5 and pickle). Only
  effective if `write_worker_results` is `True`.
- Added keyword `result_shape` in `ParallelMap` to permit specifying the
  shape of an aggregate dataset/array that results from all computational runs
  are slotted into. In conjunction with the shape specification, the new keyword
  `result_dtype` offers the option to control the numerical type (set to
  "float64" by default) of the resulting dataset (if `write_worker_results = True`)
  or array (`write_worker_results = False`). On-disk dataset results collection
  is only available for auto-generated HDF5 containers (i.e, `write_pickle = False`)
- Introduced keyword `single_file` in `ParallelMap` to control, whether parallel
  workers store results of computational runs in dedicated HDF5 files (`single_file = False`,
  default) or share a single results container for saving (`single_file = True`).
  This option is only available for auto-generated HDF5 containers, pickle
  files are not supported (i.e., `write_worker_results = True` and
  `write_pickle = False`).
- Included options to specify worker count and memory consumption in `local_cluster_setup`
- Added a new section "Advanced Usage and Customization" in the online documentation
  that discusses settings and associated technical details
- Added support for Python 3.10 and updated dask dependencies

### CHANGED
- Modified employed terminology throughout the package: to clearly delineate
  the difference between compute runs and worker processes (and to minimize
  friction between the documentation of ACME and dask), the term "worker"
  is now consistently used throughout the code base. If ACME is running on a
  SLURM cluster, a dask "worker" corresponds to a SLURM "job".
- In line with the above change, the following input arguments have been
  renamed:
  - in `ParallelMap`:
    - `n_jobs` -> `n_workers`
    - `mem_per_job` -> `mem_per_worker`
  - in `esi_cluster_setup` and `slurm_cluster_setup`:
    - `n_jobs` -> `n_workers`
    - `mem_per_job` -> `mem_per_worker`
    - `n_jobs_startup` -> `n_workers_startup`
  - in `slurm_cluster_setup`:
    - `workers_per_job` -> `processes_per_worker`
- Made `esi_cluster_setup` respect already running clients so that new parallel
  computing clients are not launched on top of existing ones (thanks to @timnaher)
- Introduced support for positional/keyword arguments of unit-length in
  `ParallelMap` so that `n_inputs` can be used as scaling parameter to launch
  `n_inputs` calls of a user-provided function
- All docstrings and the online documentation have been re-written (and in
  parts clarified) to account for the newly introduced features.
- Code coverage is not computed by a GitHub action workflow but is now
  calculated by the GitLab CI job that invokes SLURM to run tests on the
  ESI HPC cluster.

### DEPRECATED
The keywords `n_jobs`, `mem_per_job`, `n_jobs_startup` and `workers_per_job`
have been renamed. Using these keywords is still supported but raises a
`DeprecationWarning`.
- The keywords `n_jobs` and `mem_per_job` in both `ParallelMap` and
  `esi_cluster_setup` are deprecated. To specify the number of parallel
  workers and their memory resources, please use `n_workers` and  `mem_per_worker`,
  respectively (see corresponding item in the Section CHANGED above)
- The keyword `n_jobs_startup` in `esi_cluster_setup` is deprecated. Please
  use `n_workers_startup` instead

### FIXED
- Updated dependency versions (pin `click` to version < 8.1) and fixed Syncopy
  compatibility (increase recursion depth of input size estimation to one
  million calls)
- Streamlined dryrun stopping logic invoked if user chooses to not continue
  with the computation after performing a dry-run
- Modified tests that are supposed to use an existing distributed computing
  client to not shut down that very client
- Updated memory estimation routine to deactivate auto-generation of results
  files to not accidentally corrupt pre-allocated containers before launching
  the actual concurrent computation

## [2022.8] - 2022-08-05
Bugfixes, new automatic ESI-HPC SLURM partition selection, expanded Python version
compatibility and updated dependencies as well as online documentation overhaul.

### NEW
- On the ESI HPC cluster, using `partition="auto"` in `ParallelMap` now launches
  a heuristic  automatic SLURM partition selection algorithm (instead of simply
  falling back to the "8GBXS" partition on the ESI HPC cluster)

### CHANGED
- Updated package dependencies (allow `h5py` ver 3.x) and expanded support for
  recent Python versions (include 3.9)
- Restructured and expanded online documentation based on suggestions from @naehert:
  moved most examples and usage notes from `ParallelMap`'s docstring to dedicated
  docu pages and added new "Troubleshooting + FAQ" site.

### FIXED
- Repeated `ParallelMap` calls ignored differing `logfile` specifications. This
  has been corrected. In addition, the logging setup routine now ensures that only
  one `FileHandler` is used (any existing non-default log-file locations are
  removed from the logger to avoid generating multiple logs and/or accidentally
  appending to existing logs from previous runs).

## [2022.7] - 2022-07-06
Bugfixes, new versioning scheme and updated dependencies.

### CHANGED
- Modified versioning scheme: use date-based version tags instead of increasing
  numbers
- Updated `dask`, `dask-jobqueue` and `scipy` dependency requirements
- Removed any mentions of "hpx" from the code after upgrading the main file-server
  of the ESI HPC cluster

### FIXED
- Repaired broken FQDN detection in `is_esi_node`

## [0.21] - 2022-03-01
Performance improvements, new `dryrun` keyword and preparations for deploying
ACME on other clusters

### NEW
- Re-designed cluster startup code: added new function `slurm_cluster_setup` that
  includes SLURM-specific (but ESI-agnostic) code for spinning up a `SLURMCluster`
- Included new `dryrun` keyword in `ParallelMap` to test-drive ACME's automatically
  generated argument lists simulating a single (randomly picked) worker call prior
  to the actual concurrent computation (addresses #39)
- Added helper function `is_esi_node` to determine if ACME is running on the ESI
  HPC cluster

### CHANGED
- Do not parse scalars using `numbers.Number`, use `numpy.number` instead to
  catch Boolean values
- Included `conda clean` in CD pipeline to avoid disk fillup by unused conda
  packages/cache

### DEPRECATED
- Retired `conda2pip` in favor of the modern setup.cfg dependency management
  system. ACME's dependencies are now listed in setup.cfg which is used to
  populate the conda environment file acme.yml at setup time.
- Retired travis CI tests since free test runs are exhausted. Migrated to GitHub
  actions (and re-included codecov)

### FIXED
- On the ESI HPC cluster set the job CPU count depending on the chosen partition
  if not explicitly provided by the user (one core per 8GB of RAM, e.g., jobs in
  a 32GB RAM partition now use 4 cores instead of just one)

## [0.2rc3] - 2021-11-26
### NEW
- Upgraded dask version used by ACME (anything below 2021.12)
- Added macOS as officially supported platform. A corresponding CI job has been
  set up as well.

### CHANGED
- Updated `email` and `homepage` tags in setup.cfg to comply with new setuptools
  packaging standard

### FIXED
- NumPy arrays with singleton dimensions triggered a nondescript `TypeError` in
  `ACMEDaemon` due to incorrect indexing before broadcasting.

## [0.2rc2] - 2021-10-26
### CHANGED
- Updated versioning scheme to be PEP 440 compliant

### FIXED
- Updated dependency setup: dask 2.25/2.30 does not work with click 8.+ in a
  SLURM cluster context
- Refined query to check for active workers in a dask client: ensure workers
  are not only attached to a client but actually have resources available

## [v0.2rc1] - 2021-10-19
### NEW
- Included function `local_cluster_setup` to launch a local distributed Dask
  multi-processing cluster running on the host machine

### CHANGED
- Refined integration with [SyNCoPy](http://www.syncopy.org)

### FIXED
- Repaired auto-generated semantic version strings (use only release number + letter,
  remove local ".dev0" suffix from official release versions)

## [v0.2b] - 2021-08-04
### NEW
- Support for custom `sbatch` arguments (thanks to @KatharineShapcott)

### FIXED
- Made ID fetching of crashed SLURM jobs more robust
- Corrected faulty override of `print`/`showwarning` in case ACME was called
  from within SyNCoPy.
- Cleaned up fetching of SLURM worker memory
- Corrected keywords in CITATION.cff

## [v0.2a] - 2021-05-18
### NEW
- Made ACME PEP 517 compliant: added pyproject.toml and modified setup.py
  accordingly
- Added IBM POWER testing pipeline (via dedicated GitLab Runner)

### CHANGED
- New default SLURM partition set to "8GBXS" in `esi_cluster_setup`

### REMOVED
- Retired tox in `slurmtest` CI pipeline in favor of a "simple" pytest testing
  session due to file-locking problems of tox environments on NFS mounts

### FIXED
- Stream-lined GitLab Runner setup: use cluster-wide conda instead of local
  installations (that differ slightly across runners) and leverage `tox-conda`
  to fetch pre-built dependencies
- Opt-in pickling was not propagated correctly in daemon-reentry situations

## [v0.2] - 2021-05-05
### NEW
- New keyword `write_pickle` can be used to override HDF5 as default storage
  format in favor of pickle
- Included code-coverage information and corresponding requirements for pull
  requests in ACME repo
- Added software citation file `CITATION.cff`

### CHANGED
- Changed job submission system: instead of using dask bags, input arguments
  are directly propagated using dask-client methods. This has the side-effect
  that the layout of in-memory results changed: instead of returning a nested
  lists of lists, the user namespace is populated with a plain list of objects
  (simplifying result handling in the process)

### DEPRECATED
- In-memory list-of-list returns are not supported anymore; `ParallelMap` now
  returns plain (non-nested) lists.

### FIXED
- If auto-saving to HDF5 fails, a new "emergency pickling" mechanic kicks in and
  attempts to pickle the offending return values instead
- User-provided functions in custom modules are now correctly propagated
  by inheriting `sys.path` from the parent client
- Argument distribution is more memory efficient: input arguments are not
  held in memory by the scheduler and then propagated to workers anymore.
  Instead, arguments shared by all workers are broadcast to the cluster and
  referenced by the workers.
- Any user-issued `KeyboardInterrupt` (`CTRL` + `C` button press) is caught and
  triggers a graceful shutdown of all worker jobs managed by the current client
  (specifically, do not leave SLURM jobs detached from the client running in the
  background)
- Fixed progress bars that were left broken after an exception was raised

## [v0.1b] - 2021-01-15
### NEW
- This CHANGELOG file

### CHANGED
- Modified dependencies to not include Jupyter-related packages

### FIXED
- Fixed markdown syntax and URLs
- Fixed CI pipelines and repaired `h5py` version mismatch in dependencies
- Pin ACME to Python 3.8.x due to various packages not working properly
  (yet) in Python 3.9

## [v0.1a] - 2020-12-30
### NEW
- Initial ACME pre-release on PyPI

### CHANGED
- Made ACME GitHub repository public
